        <h2>About ELIOENAI</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m <strong>FRANCIS ELIOENAI OSEI </strong>, a passionate computer engineering student who loves solving problems with technology. From a young age, I was fascinated by how computers work, and that curiosity led me to study Computer Engineering.</p>
        <p>My interests include artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. I love experimenting with new technologies, building projects, and learning about how we can use technology to improve everyday life. I hope to one day create innovations that help people in meaningful ways.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing chess, watching tech documentaries, and working on fun DIY electronics projects!</p>

        <h2>What is Computer Engineering?</h2>
        <p>Computer Engineering is a field that combines computer science and electrical engineering to create powerful computer systems. It focuses on both the *hardware* (physical components) and *software* (programming) of computers.</p>
        <p>Some key areas in Computer Engineering include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming & Software Development– Writing code to create applications, websites, and systems.</li>
            <li>Microprocessors & Embedded Systems – Designing small computer chips used in smart devices.</li>
            <li>Networking & Cybersecurity* – Securing networks from hackers and protecting sensitive data.</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence & Robotics– Teaching computers how to think and make decisions.</li>
            <li>Hardware Design* – Building circuits and developing new computer technologies.</li>
        </ul>
